# IDK :D

just a simple script to fetch yt playlists vids


for more information, check [yt api docs](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)\
``note: disable OAuth 2.0``

also make sure to enable the `YouTube Data API v3 `\
and make an api key from [google console](https://console.developers.google.com/)

ill leave you with this so far, too lazy to explain how to set it all up :D

## playlist time :D
you can use it with ytdlp so you dont have to copy paste urls like i used to do :D

just saying this is the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chbGVqluhBM&list=PL06jTKAyNzxG2QCohAVmbOsiBQzoy28df&pp=gAQB),
hope you enjoy my playlist btw :D
